## Overview

The Timetracker Zapier integration provides a seamless way to:
- Automate time tracking based on calendar events, emails, or other triggers
- Sync time entries with project management tools
- Create time reports automatically
- Integrate with CRM systems for client billing
- Connect with accounting software for invoicing

## Authentication

The Zapier integration uses API key-based authentication to securely connect your Timetracker account. This ensures that only authorized users can access your time tracking data.

### Authentication Method

The integration uses a **custom authentication type** that requires your Timetracker API key. This approach provides secure, token-based access without storing your login credentials.

### Required Credentials

<ParamField body="apiKey" type="string" required>
Your Timetracker API key. This is a secure token that grants Zapier access to your account data.
</ParamField>

### Getting Your API Key

  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Copy the Key">

  </Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Authentication Flow

When you connect your Timetracker account to Zapier, the following process occurs:

1. **Input Validation**: Zapier prompts you to enter your API key
2. **Connection Test**: Zapier sends a test request to verify your credentials
3. **User Verification**: The system validates your API key and retrieves your user information
4. **Connection Established**: Upon successful authentication, the connection is established

### Test Endpoint

The authentication system uses the following endpoint to verify your credentials:

### Connection Label

Once authenticated, your Zapier connection will be labeled using your email address in the format:
```
Timetracker - your.email@example.com
```

This makes it easy to identify which Timetracker account is connected to each Zap.

## Available Triggers

The Timetracker Zapier integration provides six event triggers that can initiate automated workflows. Each trigger is designed to respond to specific actions within your Timetracker account.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Client Management">
  - **New Client**: Triggers when a new client in Timetracker is created.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Project Management">

All triggers are real-time events that fire immediately when the corresponding action occurs in your Timetracker account. This ensures your Zaps respond quickly to changes and updates.
