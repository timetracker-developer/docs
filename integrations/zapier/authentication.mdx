description: "Learn how to authenticate your Zapier integration with Timetracker using API keys and manage your connection securely"

## Overview

To connect Zapier with your Timetracker account, you'll need to authenticate using an API key. This key provides secure access to your account data and allows Zapier to perform actions on your behalf.

<Info>
API keys are the recommended authentication method for server-to-server integrations like Zapier. They're more secure than username/password authentication and provide better control over access permissions.

2. Store it securely in a password manager or secure note
