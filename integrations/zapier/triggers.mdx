## Overview

Timetracker provides five powerful triggers that automatically activate your Zaps when specific events happen in your account. These triggers use webhooks to deliver real-time data to Zapier, enabling instant automation of your workflows.

<Info>
All triggers are webhook-based, meaning they fire immediately when events occur in Timetracker. This provides real-time automation without polling delays.

- **Start simple**: Begin with one trigger per Zap
- **Consider frequency**: Some triggers (like timer events) fire more often than others
- **Match your workflow**: Choose triggers that align with your team's processes

### Data Handling

- **Validate data**: Always test triggers with sample data before going live
- **Handle errors**: Set up error handling for cases where data might be missing
- **Monitor performance**: Keep an eye on Zap execution times and success rates

### Automation Design

- **Single purpose**: Each Zap should have one clear objective
- **Error recovery**: Include fallback actions for failed executions
- **Testing**: Test thoroughly with real data before activating
