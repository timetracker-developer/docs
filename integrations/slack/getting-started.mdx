## Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Install the Slack App

1. Make sure you have a free or paid [Timetracker](https://app.timetracker.in/sign-up) account
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Integrations** â†’ **Slack** â†’ **Connect**
3. Follow the OAuth flow to authorize Timetracker in your Slack workspace

<Info>
The Slack app requires workspace admin approval. If you don't have admin rights, ask your workspace administrator to install the app.
</Info>

### Step 2: Configure User Mapping

<Warning>
**Critical**: Unmapped users will not be able to use the `/timetracker` commands. You must complete this step for the integration to work.
</Warning>

1. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Integrations** â†’ **Slack** â†’ **Configure** button
2. This will take you to the `/slack-config` page where you'll see three sections to manage user connections:

- **Unmapped Slack Users**: Find your Slack username in this list
- **Unmapped Team Members**: Find your Timetracker account in this list  
- **Currently Mapped Users**: Shows successfully connected accounts

**How user mapping works:**
- Each Slack user must be linked to a corresponding Timetracker team member account
- This mapping tells the system which Timetracker account should receive the time entries from each Slack user
- Without this mapping, commands will fail because the system doesn't know where to save the time data

**To connect your accounts:**
1. Use the dropdown menu next to your Slack username to select your corresponding Timetracker account
2. Click **Sync Users** to refresh the user list if needed
3. Test the connection by running `/timetracker help` in any Slack channel

<Check>
**Success**: You'll see the help message with available commands when the connection is working properly.
</Check>

### Step 3: Try Your First Command

Let's start with a simple time tracking command:

**Example: Start a timer**

1. In any Slack channel, type: `/timetracker start description:"Working on project documentation"`
2. Press Enter to execute the command
3. You'll see a confirmation message with your active timer
4. Check your Timetracker dashboard to see the running timer
