## Best Practices

### Effective Time Tracking Habits

#### Use Descriptive Commands

<CodeGroup>
```bash ✅ Good - Specific and Clear
/timetracker start project:"ACME Corp Website" task:"User Dashboard" description:"Implementing real-time data visualization"
```

```bash ❌ Poor - Too Vague
/timetracker start description:"Working"
```
</CodeGroup>

**Why descriptive commands matter:**
- Better reporting and analysis
- Easier to understand what was worked on
- More accurate project time allocation
- Helpful for client billing and project management

#### Organize with Projects and Tasks

<CodeGroup>
```bash ✅ Good - Well Organized
/timetracker start project:"Client Website" task:"Homepage" description:"Responsive design implementation"
```

```bash ❌ Poor - Everything in Description
/timetracker start description:"Client Website Homepage responsive design implementation"
```
</CodeGroup>

**Benefits of proper organization:**
- **Projects**: Group related work by client, department, or initiative
- **Tasks**: Break down projects into specific work items
- **Hierarchy**: Clear structure for filtering and reporting
- **Consistency**: Standardized naming across your team

#### Use Tags Effectively

<CodeGroup>
```bash ✅ Good - Meaningful Tags
/timetracker log 3.0 project:"Development" description:"API optimization" tags:"performance,backend,optimization"
```

```bash ❌ Poor - Generic Tags
/timetracker log 3.0 project:"Development" description:"API optimization" tags:"work,stuff,things"
```
</CodeGroup>

**Effective tag categories:**
- **Priority**: `urgent`, `high`, `low`
- **Type**: `meeting`, `development`, `design`, `research`
- **Technology**: `frontend`, `backend`, `mobile`, `api`
- **Status**: `bugfix`, `feature`, `maintenance`

#### Regular Status Checks

**Make it a habit:**
```bash
# Check your status regularly
/timetracker status

# Review your time at the end of each day
/timetracker status
```

**Benefits:**
- Stay aware of running timers
- Catch forgotten timers early
- Review daily time allocation
- Ensure accurate time tracking

### Project Management Best Practices

#### Consistent Project Naming

**Good naming conventions:**
- **Client projects**: "Client Name - Project Type" (e.g., "ACME Corp - Website")
- **Internal projects**: "Internal - Department" (e.g., "Internal - Marketing")
- **Department work**: "Department - Initiative" (e.g., "Engineering - Infrastructure")

**Avoid:**
- Inconsistent capitalization
- Abbreviations that aren't clear
- Generic names like "Project 1" or "Work"

#### Task Organization

**Effective task structure:**
- **Feature-based**: "User Authentication", "Payment Processing"
- **Phase-based**: "Planning", "Development", "Testing", "Deployment"
- **Deliverable-based**: "User Research", "Code Review", "Documentation"

#### Time Entry Accuracy

**Tips for accurate time tracking:**
- Start timers when you begin work
- Stop timers when you finish or switch tasks
- Use the log command for retrospective entries
- Be honest about time spent on different activities
