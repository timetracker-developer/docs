## Authentication

To use the **Timetracker API**, every request must include an authentication header Use `X-Api-Key` with your personal API key

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.timetracker.app/v1/workspaces" \   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \   -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

## Webhooks

**Webhooks** help keep your add-on in sync with the latest activity inside **Timetracker**. With Timetracker’s webhooks, you can receive real-time notifications whenever key events occur—such as when a user starts a timer, stops tracking, or deletes a time entry.

This means your integrations can react instantly to changes, without needing to constantly poll the API.
