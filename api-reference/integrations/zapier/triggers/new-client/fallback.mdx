title: "Fallback Data"
description: "Retrieve sample client data for testing Zapier triggers and previewing data structures."
---

## Overview

The fallback endpoint provides sample client data for Zapier trigger testing and configuration. When setting up a "New Client" trigger, Zapier uses this endpoint to show users the expected data structure, making it easier to configure workflows before activating live webhook subscriptions.

<Note>
This endpoint intelligently returns your most recent client data when available, or consistent sample data for testing when your workspace has no clients yet.
</Note>

## Authentication

All requests require a valid API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Get Sample Data

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET 'https://app.timetracker.in/api/integrations/zapier/triggers/clients/fallback' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://app.timetracker.in/api/integrations/zapier/triggers/clients/fallback', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data[0]); // First (and typically only) client object
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://app.timetracker.in/api/integrations/zapier/triggers/clients/fallback"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
client_data = response.json()[0]  # First client object
```

</CodeGroup>

## Response

## Zapier Integration Workflow

### How Zapier Uses This Endpoint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger Configuration">
    When you set up a "New Client" trigger in Zapier, it automatically calls this endpoint to fetch sample data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data Structure Display">
    Zapier shows you the returned client data structure, including all available fields and their formats.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Field Mapping Setup">
    You can map specific client fields (like `name`, `email`, `phone`) to actions in your workflow.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Testing & Validation">
    Use the sample data to test your workflow logic before activating live webhook notifications.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Production Activation">
    Once configured, Zapier switches to receiving real-time data via webhook subscriptions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: The data structure shown during setup matches exactly what you'll receive in live webhook payloads, so you can confidently design your workflows around the sample data.
</Tip>

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Zapier Trigger Setup">
    **Primary Use**: Zapier automatically calls this endpoint when users configure "New Client" triggers to show them what data will be available.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Integration Development">
    **Development Use**: Test your integration logic with consistent, predictable data structures before connecting to live client creation events.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Documentation & Training">
    **Reference Use**: Use the returned data structure to document what fields are available in your client management workflows.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Workflow Validation">
    **Testing Use**: Validate that your automation workflows can handle all the client data fields before going live.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Data Consistency Guarantee**: The structure returned by this endpoint exactly matches the webhook payload format, ensuring seamless transition from testing to production.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Workspace Isolation**: Only returns real client data from your authenticated workspace. Cross-workspace data access is prevented for security.
</Info>

<Check>
**Integration Best Practices**:
- Always test your workflows with this sample data first
- The endpoint returns an array, so access the first element: `data[0]`
- All dates use ISO 8601 format for consistent parsing
- Client IDs are always UUIDs for reliable identification
- Phone numbers include country codes when available
</Check>

## Testing Your Integration

To test how your application handles client data:

1. **Call the endpoint** with your API credentials
2. **Parse the response** and extract the first client object
3. **Validate data types** match your expected formats
4. **Test field mapping** for your specific use case
5. **Handle edge cases** like missing optional fields

This ensures your integration works smoothly when real client data starts flowing through webhooks.
